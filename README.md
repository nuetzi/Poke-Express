# Poke-Express
 Make a Pokemon app that displays data inside server-side rendered views


The User Stories

    When a user goes to the /pokemon route they will see an index of pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
    When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's SHOW page, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
    When a user goes to /pokemon/new a user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to /pokemon
    When a user goes to the SHOW page there will be two buttons one that allows them to delete the pokemon and get taken back to the index page and one that takes them to /pokemon/:id/edit that shows them a form that allows them to edit the pokemon data

Assignment
