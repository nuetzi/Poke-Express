User Stories

    When a user goes to the /pokemon route they will see an index of pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
    When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's show page, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
    When a user goes to /pokemon/new a user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to /pokemon
    When a user goes to the show page there will be two buttons:
         one that allows them to delete the pokemon and get taken back to the index page
         one that takes them to /pokemon/:id/edit that shows them a form that allows them to edit the pokemon data
